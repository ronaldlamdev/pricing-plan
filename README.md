This is a Frontend Mentor challenge (Pricing Component with Toggle) created using React and Tailwind CSS. Initially used TypeScript, but later realized it wasn't 
necessary to use it so later reverted back to JSX.

#Challenges faced during this project

-My biggest problem that I encountered when doing this challenge is I wanted to use TypeScript to practice. This project was also the first project I used TypeScript 
on, however, whenever it was time to create context for the toggle to switch between Annual and Monthly rate, I kept getting so many type issues with TypeScript
that I realized that maybe I shouldn't use TypeScript. So I had to revert back to JSX to easily code to how I want when using Context.

-Having 2 backgrounds for screen sizes >= 480px

#What I learned

-The best time to use TypeScript was for larger scale projects. This project was small so using TypeScript was unnecessary. I also 
 got a taste of how "disciplined" and strict TypeScript is.
 
 -How to add multiple backgrounds with a comma in between url(/background url/) and manage background properties with comma.
 
 #What I want to improve
 
 -Practice TypeScript skills and understanding how TypeScript works
 -Better understand Context API
 -Learn more advanced React hooks
 -Maybe learn Next.JS
 -Maybe learn a new CSS framework
